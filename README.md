## Lab Assignments

### Lab Assignment 1

In this lab, we focus on basic drawing techniques and shapes. Below are the tasks included in this assignment.

#### Task 1: Drawing Pixels

In this task, you will draw 50 pixels at random coordinate points. To achieve this, generate 100 random values (50 x-coordinates and 50 y-coordinates). There is no need to connect the pixels.

#### Task 2: House Building

For this task, you will create a house using basic primitives such as points, lines, or triangles. You can utilize GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, or GL_TRIANGLES for your design. Feel free to modify the house design to your liking. Below is an example diagram:

#### Task 3: Student ID

Display your Student ID with each digit in a different color.
